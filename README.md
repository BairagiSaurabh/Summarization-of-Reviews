# Summarization-of-Reviews

The ML model takes in a single URL from E-commerce website as an input
and the number of pages you want to get reviews from and makes an interactive
dashboard by extracting aspects and predicting sentiments for the reviews.

This model can save a lot of customers time by summarizing the whole bunch of
reviews and displaying them in form of plots so that the customer can make
better purchase decision.
